## File deletions on Wikimedia Commons - Breakdown by Time (Redux)

This report is a replicate of Mikhail's report in October 2017, reviewing the time to deletion for files uploaded on Wikimedia Commons. Questions reviewed included: 

1. Time to deletion, broken up by file type and reason for deletion (copyright violation vs. other).
2. The proportion of files deleted within a month after uploaded. How does this deletion rate look like over time? I looked at both proportion of all uploaded files (both deleted and not deleted before 2018-02-01) and just uploaded files that were deleted before 2018-02-01.

Ticket: [T18675](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T186575)


### 1. Time to deletion, broken up by file type and reason for deletion (copyright violation vs. other).

```{r}

    OR INSTR(LOWER(CONVERT(fa_deleted_reason USING utf8)), 'trademark') > 0
    OR INSTR(LOWER(CONVERT(fa_deleted_reason USING utf8)), 'logo') > 0
    OR INSTR(LOWER(CONVERT(fa_deleted_reason USING utf8)), 'fair use') > 0
    OR INSTR(LOWER(CONVERT(fa_deleted_reason USING utf8)), 'dmca') > 0
    OR INSTR(LOWER(CONVERT(fa_deleted_reason USING utf8)), 'non-free') > 0
    OR INSTR(LOWER(CONVERT(fa_deleted_reason USING utf8)), 'not free') > 0

### 2. The proportion of files deleted within a month after uploaded. How does this deletion rate look like over time?

monthly_deletions$upload_month <- as.Date(monthly_deletions$upload_month)
#Revise delete in month to factor and clarfiy TRUE and FALSE labels. 
monthly_deletions$delete_in_month %<>% factor(c(TRUE, FALSE), c("Within 1 month of upload", "After 1 month since upload"))

## Proportion of files deleted within a month of upload (Looking at all uploaded file each month [deleted and not deleted as of 2018-02-01])

The above plots only account for files deleted before 2018-02-01. I also reviewed the proportion of all uploaded files each month both deleted and not deleted as of 2018-02-01. 

```{r}
all_uploads_result <- "SELECT 
upload_date, COUNT(*) AS uploads

SELECT
DATE(LEFT(filearchive.`fa_timestamp`, 8)) AS upload_date
FROM filearchive
UNION ALL
SELECT
DATE(LEFT(image.`img_timestamp`, 8)) AS upload_date
FROM image
) AS dates
GROUP BY upload_date;
